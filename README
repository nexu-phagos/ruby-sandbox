Ruby testing environment... not much more to say about this for now. Mainly for testing purposes.

Process for creating a new Git repo from local 
(ASSUMING THERE IS NO REMOTE REPO):

# go to local directory where you want to create the repo
1. cd "git-repos"

# create the repository, name it what you like
2. git init "repoName"

# create a readme file
3. gedit README

# add all files in the repo to the index
4. git add -A 

# make first commit with relevant message
5. git commit -m "relevant message"

# IF THERE ISN'T ALREADY A REMOTE REPOSITORY:
6. git remote add origin https://github.com/nexu-phagos/"name-of-repo".git

# push the local commits to the remote repo
7. git push -u origin master
